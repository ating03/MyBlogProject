                          HISTORY OF PYTHON
                        </h2>
                     <p> It was created by Guido Van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.</p>
                     <p>The Python programming language originally comes from Monty Python's Flying Circus, an old BBC sketch comedy show.</p>
                     <p>One of the most astonishing aspects about Python is that it was created by a single person. New programming languages are usually developed and published by huge corporations with a large number of employees, and due to copyright laws, it is difficult to identify any of the individuals involved in the project. Python is an outlier.

                        Van Rossum did not, of course, create and evolve all of the Python components himself. The rapid spread of Python around the world is due to the tireless efforts of thousands of (often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of whom are not IT specialists), and enthusiasts, but it must be noted that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came from one person – Guido.</p>
                    <p>In 1999, Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:

                        an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors;
                        open source, so anyone can contribute to its development;
                        code that is as understandable as plain English;
                        suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.</p>
                    <p>After almost 20 years, it is evident that all of these goals have been realized. According to some sources, Python is the world's third most popular programming language, while others believe it is the fifth.</p>

                            PROGRAMMING PARADIGM IN PYTHON

                            Python supports three types of Programming paradigms.
                        </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Object Oriented programming paradigms</li>
                            <li>Procedure Oriented programming paradigms</li>

                          <p>Objects are the most important part of the object-oriented programming paradigm. Objects are just instances of a class that contain data members as well as method functions. Furthermore, the object-oriented programming paradigm connects data members and methods functions to support encapsulation, and the code can be easily reused thanks to the concept of inheritance. However, the major disadvantage of the object-oriented programming paradigm is that if the code is not written properly, the program becomes a monster.</p>
                          <p>Thus, in the sample code class Emp was defined first and then the objects of the class which are the names and age of the persons. After the  object of the class was called as emp.info to display the Objects. </p>
